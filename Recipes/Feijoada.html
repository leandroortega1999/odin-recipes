<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean stew that maintains the rich smoky, <br>
    flavors famous in Brazil. Additional meats, including sausage, may be added if desired. This is <br>
    excellent served over brown rice.
</p>

<h3>Ingridients</h3>

<ul>

    <li>1 (12 ounce) package dry black beans, soaked overnight</li>
    <li>1½ cups chopped onion, divided</li>
    <li>½ cup green onions, chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>2 smoked ham hocks</li>
    <li>8 ounces diced ham</li>
    <li>½ pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <p>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup of chopped onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and <br>
    stir until softened, about 4 minutes. Pour in the soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 <br>
    inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.</li>
    </p>

    <p>
    <li>
    While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in smaller pot with 1/4 cup of the chopped onion. Cover with water <br>
    and simmer, until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour. Drain and add to the beans.
    </li>
    </p>

    <p>
    <li>
    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake 15<br>
    minutes or until mixture is crispy.
    </li>
    </p>

    <p>
    <li>
    Drain the bacon and ham mixture, and add to the beans. Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt and pepper. Simmer<br>
    uncovered 30 minutes more. Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving.
    </li>
